# ⚡ Washington State Electric Vehicle Population Analysis
📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive geospatial and technical analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) population in Washington State. By leveraging the WADOL 2026 dataset, this study explores adoption trends, battery technology maturation, and geographic concentration to provide actionable insights for infrastructure planning and legislative advocacy.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Plotly Express, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Geospatial: Plotly Mapbox (Carto-Darkmatter)

Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud

🚀 Key Features
Temporal Growth Analysis: Tracking the registration inflection point post-2020.

Market Dynamics: Comparative study of manufacturer dominance and model diversity.

Technical Benchmarking: Evaluating the evolution of average electric range by manufacturer and propulsion type (BEV vs. PHEV).

Geospatial Intelligence: A high-fidelity density heatmap identifying "Adoption Hotspots" and "Charging Deserts."

Interactive Exploration: A professional-grade dashboard allowing users to filter by Manufacturer, Model Year, and Technology Type.
